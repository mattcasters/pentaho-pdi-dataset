# pentaho-pdi-dataset

This is a set of PDI plugins to more easily work with data sets. 
We also want to provide Test Driven Development (TDD) capabilities through unit tests, input data sets and golden data sets.

# build instructions

- mvn clean install 

# Installation instructions

Copy file "dist/pentaho-pdi-dataset-TRUNK-SNAPSHOT.jar" to the plugins/ folder of your Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle) distribution.  Any location in that folder or subfolder is fine to make the plugin work.  Currently there are no extra libraries that need to be deployed.
